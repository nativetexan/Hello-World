# Hello-World
A complete newbie trying to figure out github and code by myself. I have been humbled by the level of intelligence I've come across learning to setup a joomla site and the cooperation between most people is awesome. I inspire to be helpful to ya'll in the future. I'm a home inspector, so if you have questions about your house, I'll be happy to try and help.
