# Hello-World
A complete newbie trying to figure out github and code by myself. I have been humbled by the level of intelligence I've come across learning to setup a joomla site and the cooperation between most people is awesome. I inspire to be helpful to ya'll in the future. I'm a home inspector, so if you have questions about your house, I'll be happy to try and help. 
I stumbled across github by accident trying to figure out another php issue after a joomla update and saw all the fascinating stuff everyone was working on and, well I just started downloading. Of course, I had a heck of a time making any of it working, I had never heard of putty, node js. My site attacked by Chinease bots last week as I had turned down the security a bit to work on it and I ran across an article of one of the bright people here saying she was disappointed about an issue that was not overcome. It hit me that ya'll are working and..I'm just playing. I felt bad, I probably started 5-6 projects I had no chance success and saw over at park break..no breakstop the video formatter handbreak, I think, they were counting how many failures people had setting it up. So, I am gonna put some effort in learning some code! Heck, I had to learn about matching fonts for the blog I made my family and never, never even saw that one coming, hehe.  I'll never catch up to ya'll, but I will improve.   nativetexan
